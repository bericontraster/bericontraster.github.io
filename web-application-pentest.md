description: OWASP Top 10 coverage plus manual business logic testing to find real application flaws.
---

This pentest combines OWASP Top 10 coverage with deep manual testing of business logic. The goal is to uncover flaws that break real workflows, not just trigger scanner alerts.

## Manual Logic Testing
Automated tools can flag common issues, but they do not understand your application flow. I test how users, roles, and transactions interact to uncover authorization gaps, abuse cases, and logic flaws that directly impact revenue and data integrity.

## The Problem
Modern applications move fast and ship complex features. Logic flaws, broken access control, and insecure integrations often bypass traditional security testing and lead to high-impact incidents.

## Our Approach
1. Recon: Review app architecture, user roles, and critical workflows.
2. Enumeration: Map endpoints, input vectors, and trust boundaries with manual validation.
3. Exploitation: Safely demonstrate real-world impact across OWASP and logic flaws.
4. Post-Exploitation: Assess data exposure, account takeover paths, and systemic risk.

## The Deliverables
- Executive Summary tailored to business and product risk.
- Technical Breakdown with evidence, impact, and fixes.
- Remediation Roadmap that prioritizes secure design changes.
- 1-year re-test window to validate fixes and reduce regression risk.

## Why Me
I deliver OSCP and CPTS-grade testing with a manual-first mindset. You get precise findings that explain how the flaw works in your actual application flow.
