description: Assumed-breach testing focused on Active Directory security, lateral movement, and privilege escalation chains.
---

This assessment assumes the perimeter has been breached and focuses on how far an attacker can move inside. The priority is Active Directory security, lateral movement paths, and privilege escalation risk across critical systems.

## The Path to Domain Admin
Most internal compromise happens through weak identity controls, over-permissioned accounts, and misconfigurations that chain together. I identify those chains and show the exact path to domain-level control, so you can break it before a real attacker does.

## The Problem
Internal networks often have hidden trust relationships, legacy misconfigurations, and reused credentials. A single foothold can quickly become full domain compromise if controls are not validated.

## Our Approach
1. Recon: Identify host inventory, user roles, and trust boundaries in the internal environment.
2. Enumeration: Map Active Directory objects, access paths, and misconfigurations with manual verification.
3. Exploitation: Demonstrate lateral movement and privilege escalation using CPTS-grade techniques.
4. Post-Exploitation: Assess data access, persistence opportunities, and blast radius.

## The Deliverables
- Executive Summary that explains business impact of internal compromise.
- Technical Breakdown with step-by-step attack paths and proof.
- Remediation Roadmap focused on AD hardening and identity controls.
- 1-year re-test window to validate fixes and reduce escalation risk.

## Why Me
I bring OSCP and CPTS rigor to internal testing and focus on real attacker paths, not just configuration checklists. You get actionable fixes that meaningfully reduce breach impact.
