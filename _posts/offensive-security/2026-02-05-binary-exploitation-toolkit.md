## Ghidra 
Ghidra is a free, open-source software reverse engineering (SRE) framework developed by the
NSA, released in 2019. It enables security professionals and malware analysts to disassemble, decompile, and analyze compiled code such as malware or binary files without running them. It is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra). 

It can also be installed via apt package manager on various linux distributions. On Kali it can be insalled with `sudo apt install ghidra`.

## GDB Debuggers
GDB (GNU Debugger) is a powerful, open-source command-line tool used to debug programs written in C, C++, Go, and other compiled languages on Unix-like systems. It allows developers to monitor, control, and analyze the execution of a program, making it essential for detecting crashes, inspecting memory, and fixing bug.

1. [PWNDBG](https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg) is a GDB and LLDB plug-in that makes debugging suck less.
2. [Peda](https://github.com/longld/peda) - Python Exploit Development Assistance for GDB.
3. [GEF](https://github.com/hugsy/gef) is a set of commands for x86/64, ARM, MIPS, PowerPC and SPARC to assist exploit developers and reverse-engineers when using old school GDB.

## Binary Analysis
### CheckSec

[Checksec](https://github.com/slimm609/checksec) is a widely used tool, originally a bash script by Tobias Klein, designed to quickly check the security properties and mitigation technologies of Linux executables (e.g., PIE, RELRO, Canaries, ASLR, Fortify Source) and the kernel.

```shell
# APT
sudo apt install checksec

# DNF
sudo dnf install checksec
```
