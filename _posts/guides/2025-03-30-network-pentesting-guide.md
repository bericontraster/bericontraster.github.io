### Nmap Scans

[Nmap](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nmap&ved=2ahUKEwifksPOouSOAxVms1YBHdHtObYQmhN6BAg0EAQ&usg=AOvVaw0PI_u5gUbhEAOzSewimiSk) is a network scanner created by Gordon Lyon. Nmap is used to discover hosts and services on a computer network by sending packets and analyzing the responses. Nmap provides a number of features for probing computer networks, including host discovery and service and operating system detection.

```shell
nmap -sC -sV -p -vvv IP -oX "filename.xml"
```
{: .nolineno}

Convert the `.xml` file to `.html`.
```shell
apt install xsltproc
xsltproc filename.xml -o filename.html
```
{: .nolineno}
