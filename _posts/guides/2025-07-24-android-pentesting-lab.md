Hey Hackers, In this blog we will setup ultimate android pentesting lab. We will start of by installing must have tools.

## Installing ADB (Android Debug Bridge) 🔌

ADB is a versatile command-line tool that allows you to communicate with Android devices or emulators. It’s essential for tasks like:

- Installing and debugging apps
- Accessing device logs
- Running shell commands directly on the device
- Forwarding ports or mirroring traffic

```shell
sudo apt update && sudo apt install adb
```
{: .nolineno}

> After installing, connect your Android device via USB and run adb devices to verify it's recognized.

## Installing APKTool 🧰

APKTool is used to decompile and recompile APK files. It allows you to reverse engineer APK resources and makes it easier to analyze or modify app internals such as:

- AndroidManifest.xml
- Smali code
- Resource files (layouts, images, etc.)

```shell
sudo apt install apktool
```
{: .nolineno}

## Installing JADX (Decompilation Tool) 🔍

JADX is a command-line and GUI tool that decompiles Android APKs into Java-like source code from .dex files. It’s an incredibly useful static analysis tool when you want to:

- Understand app logic
- Look for hardcoded secrets (API keys, credentials)
- Trace function calls

```shell
sudo apt install default-jdk
sudo apt install jadx
```
{: .nolineno}

You can also install jadx-gui for a visual interface.
```shell
sudo snap install jadx --classic
```
{: .nolineno}

## Setting Up MobSF (Mobile Security Framework) 🐳

MobSF (Mobile Security Framework) is a powerful and automated pentesting tool for mobile apps (Android/iOS). It supports both static and dynamic analysis and provides:

- Vulnerability analysis reports
- Code and manifest analysis
- API endpoint detection
- namic runtime instrumentation (if using with emulator/device)

We'll use the Docker version to keep things clean and OS-agnostic.
Install Docker (if not already):

```shell
sudo apt install docker.io
```
{: .nolineno}

Pull MobSF image:

```shell
sudo docker pull opensecurity/mobile-security-framework-mobsf
```
{: .nolineno}

Run MobSF:

```shell
sudo docker run -it --rm -p 8000:8000 opensecurity/mobile-security-framework-mobsf:latest
```
{: .nolineno}

Once it's running, access it via [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in your browser.

> Drag and drop APK files into the interface for an instant security report.

## Gennymotion 🎴

[Gennymotion](https://www.genymotion.com/) is a android emulator. An Android emulator is a software-based simulation of an Android device that allows developers and users to run and test Android applications on a computer without the need for physical devices.

### Setting up Gennymotion

We can download gennymotion from [here](https://www.genymotion.com/product-desktop/download/). I will be downloading for windows.  

After installation we will need an account to login, we can [register](https://www-v1.genymotion.com/account/create/) an account and then login into the installed application.

## Creting and Confirguring Emulator

Gennymoiton has various models and android versions we can use while creating a machine. For pentesting purposes we can use android 11 because it's already root and we will need root access for setting up Burp Suite with gennymotion.

We will also need a binary of [openssl](https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html) in windows to setup the certificates for Burp Suite. Futher we can use this guide here to setup the certificate.

### Openssl Commands for Converting the Burp Cert

```shell
openssl x509 -inform DER -in cacert.der -out burp.pem
openssl x509 -inform PEM -subject_hash_old -in burp.pem
mv burp.pem 9a5ba575.0
adb root
adb remount
adb push 9a5ba575.0 /sdcard/
adb shell
mv /sdcard/9a5ba575.0 /system/etc/security/cacerts/
chmod 644 /system/etc/security/cacerts/9a5ba575.0
```
{: .nolineno}

### Pointing Genymotion at Burp

```shell
adb shell settings put global http_proxy localhost:<some port>
adb reverse tcp:<some port> tcp:<port burp is listening on>
```
{: .nolineno}
