description: Attacker-focused external testing that exposes shadow IT, leaked credentials, and real internet-facing risk.
---

External exposure is where most breaches start. This assessment maps your real internet footprint and validates what an attacker can reach, including shadow IT and leaked access paths.

## Beyond the Port Scan
Automated scanners show open ports. I go further by combining OSINT, certificate transparency, DNS intelligence, and cloud footprint analysis to uncover forgotten assets, misconfigured services, and credential reuse. The result is an attacker's eye view of what is truly exposed and exploitable.

## The Problem
Public-facing assets drift over time: new subdomains, vendor tools, forgotten environments, and stale credentials. That blind spot creates a direct path to compromise and reputational damage.

## Our Approach
1. Recon: Identify domains, subdomains, cloud services, and exposed endpoints using targeted OSINT and asset discovery.
2. Enumeration: Validate ownership, access controls, and security posture of every reachable service.
3. Exploitation: Safely prove real impact using manual verification, not just automated findings.
4. Post-Exploitation: Map potential pivot paths and data access risk from external entry points.

## The Deliverables
- Executive Summary aligned to business risk and likelihood.
- Technical Breakdown with evidence, severity rationale, and reproduction steps.
- Remediation Roadmap prioritized by exposure and impact.
- 1-year re-test window to confirm fixes and reduce external risk.

## Why Me
I test to OSCP and CPTS standards and focus on manual validation over noisy automation. You get precise, defensible findings that support audits and real risk reduction.
