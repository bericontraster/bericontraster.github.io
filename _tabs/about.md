## Hi, I’m Muhammad Zubair

I’m an Offensive Security Professional focused on identifying the vulnerabilities that actually matter the ones real attackers would exploit to cause meaningful impact.

My work centers on real-world attack simulation across web applications, APIs, Active Directory, cloud, and internal environments. Rather than isolated findings, I focus on chaining weaknesses into realistic attack paths and translating them into clear, actionable risk for engineering teams and leadership.

I’m **OSCP-certified**, have hands-on experience delivering penetration tests for high-impact and regulated environments, and design enterprise-grade offensive security labs and training programs to help teams build practical defensive capability.

## My Journey

My path into IT and cybersecurity didn’t start in a classroom. It started with games. I was that kid who couldn’t just play. I needed to know how everything worked behind the scenes. That curiosity pushed me into game development, and that’s where I wrote my first lines of code.

A friend eventually introduced me to cybersecurity, and honestly, it was love at first sight. The challenge, the problem-solving, the adrenaline, it all clicked. From that moment, I dove in headfirst.

I enrolled in a Cybersecurity degree at university, but financial hurdles and the weak cybersecurity curriculum in Pakistan held me back. Still, I wasn’t stopping. I stumbled onto TryHackMe, then HackTheBox, and that opened an entire universe for me. I pushed through CPTS, then OSCP, countless restless days and nights, but all fueled by passion, not pressure.

And it paid off. I landed my first cybersecurity role as an Information Security Engineer, and I’m still learning, still growing, and still doing it for the love of the game.

## My Resume

I’ve created two industry-standard training courses featuring 20+ custom hands-on labs built on AWS and Proxmox, and I’ve delivered these trainings internationally. In my current role, I actively work on penetration testing projects, staying sharp through real-world assessments as well as platforms like HackTheBox and various CTF challenges.

I also write regularly on Medium and my personal site, where I break down security concepts and share practical guidance to help others level up in cybersecurity.
