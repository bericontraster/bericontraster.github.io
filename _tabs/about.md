## Hi, I’m Muhammad Zubair

I’m an Offensive Security Professional focused on identifying the vulnerabilities that actually matter.  

My work focuses on simulating real-world attacks across web applications, APIs, Active Directory, cloud environments, and internal systems. I focus on identifying weaknesses and translating them into realistic attack paths, ultimately presenting clear, actionable risks to engineering teams and leadership.  

I’m **OSCP-certified**, have hands-on experience delivering penetration tests for high-impact and regulated environments, and design enterprise-grade offensive security labs and training programs to help teams build practical defensive capability.

## My Journey

My path into IT and cybersecurity didn’t start in a classroom. It started with games. I was that kid who couldn’t just play. I needed to know how everything worked behind the scenes. That curiosity pushed me into game development, and that’s where I wrote my first lines of code.

A friend eventually introduced me to cybersecurity, and honestly, it was love at first sight. The challenge, the problem-solving, the adrenaline, it all clicked. From that moment, I dove in headfirst.

I enrolled in a Cybersecurity degree at university, but financial hurdles and the weak cybersecurity curriculum in Pakistan held me back. Still, I wasn’t stopping. I stumbled onto TryHackMe, then HackTheBox, and that opened an entire universe for me. I pushed through CPTS, then OSCP, countless restless days and nights, but all fueled by passion, not pressure.

And it paid off. I landed my first cybersecurity role as an Information Security Engineer, and I’m still learning, still growing, and still doing it for the love of the game.

## My Resume

I’ve created two industry-standard training courses featuring 20+ custom hands-on labs built on AWS and Proxmox, and I’ve delivered these trainings internationally. In my current role, I actively work on penetration testing projects, staying sharp through real-world assessments as well as platforms like HackTheBox and various CTF challenges.

I also write regularly on Medium and my personal site, where I break down security concepts and share practical guidance to help others level up in cybersecurity.

### Offensive Security Curriculum Architecture

Developed two industry-standard offensive security courses comparable to PNPT, encompassing Web, Active
Directory, and AI exploitation vectors. I architected the final practical examinations, managed global certification
issuance, and personally trained over 50 students and corporate professionals on real-world adversary TTPs.
 
### Enterprise Compliance Architecture: ACSC Essential Eight

Built and handled most of the development and security architecture of a large-scale backend application with
admin and user dashboards to automate Essential Eight (ACSC) compliance for enterprise clients.

### Real-Time AI Vishing & Voice Synthesis Engine

Co-developed a vishing (voice-phishing) platform using ElevenLabs, Twilio, and AI models to simulate realistic
social engineering attacks and execute automated campaigns that enhanced client security awareness.

### Active Directory Training Labs [↗](https://github.com/bericontraster/enterprise-offensive-security-labs)
I engineered vulnerable Active Directory environments designed to mirror the architectural flaws found in modern enterprise networks. Beyond infrastructure setup, I authored comprehensive exploitation guides on Medium, detailing the bridge between theoretical vulnerabilities and real-world adversary tradecraft.

- **Key Focus Areas:** Kerberoasting, ACL abuse, constrained delegation, and complex cross-forest escalation paths.
- **Impact:** Bridging the gap for aspiring security professionals by providing high-fidelity, hands-on training scenarios.
