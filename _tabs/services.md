# Compliance-Ready Vulnerability Scan + Letter

## Meet the audit deadline without the pentest circus

You need a fast, practical security check and a letter you can hand to an auditor or vendor today. This service gives you a clear vulnerability scan and a compliance-ready letter so you can keep deals moving, without getting dragged into a months-long engagement.

## If this sounds familiar...

- An auditor or buyer asked for a recent vulnerability scan and you do not have one.
- Vendor onboarding stalled because you cannot provide a security letter.
- You have a compliance deadline but no time to manage a full penetration test.
- You need something credible and defensible, not a 40-page sales pitch.
- You are the accidental security person and you just need this handled.

## What the Vulnerability Scan includes

- External and internal scan coverage based on your environment and scope.
- Identification of common, high-impact issues that auditors look for.
- Clear, prioritized findings with business-safe language.
- A short debrief to confirm what matters and what does not.

## What the Compliance Letter is and why it matters

The Compliance Letter is a signed summary of the scan scope, timing, and high-level results. It is written for auditors, clients, and vendor security reviewers so they can check the box and move forward. It is not marketing. It is a concise, professional statement you can send with confidence.

## What this service is NOT

- Not a full penetration test.
- Not red teaming or adversary simulation.
- Not enterprise consulting.
- Not a guarantee that you are perfectly secure.
- Not a replacement for a broader security program.

## Who this service is for (and who it is not for)

For:
- SMBs, startups, and SaaS teams facing audit, vendor, or client security requirements.
- Leaders who need a clear, defensible answer fast.
- Teams without a dedicated security function.

Not for:
- Organizations that need deep exploit testing or full scope penetration testing.
- Teams looking for a long-term security program buildout right now.

## How the process works

1) Quick scope call to confirm systems, access, and timeline.
2) You provide access details and a point of contact.
3) I run the scan and validate results for accuracy.
4) You receive the report and Compliance Letter.
5) Optional Q&A so you feel ready for review.

## Timeline and delivery expectations

Most engagements complete in a few business days. If you have a hard deadline, say so and we will plan around it. The goal is speed without shortcuts that create audit risk.

## What you receive

- Vulnerability Scan Report with prioritized findings.
- Compliance Letter you can submit to auditors or vendors.
- Summary notes you can share internally.

## Why this works for audits and vendor reviews

Auditors and vendor teams need evidence, not a storyline. This package provides the exact artifacts they look for, with clear scope and dates. You get a credible, defensible response that keeps the process moving.

## Why work with an independent cybersecurity consultant

You get focus, speed, and direct accountability. No junior handoffs, no agency delays, no upsell pressure. Just the work you need, delivered by someone who understands the practical reality of SMB security and compliance.
